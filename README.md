#Lost in Peril
==================
## Tim Mardesen and Dennis McMeekan

## LibGDX powered to Android and Windows.

This is a game created with the purpose of fulfilling a requirement of a Software Engineering course
during our times as undergrads at Western Illinois University.

With this project, we felt it was necessary for our development skills to grow with the implementation of an above and beyond
indie game. This began as a project needing to meet requirements, but as developed into a full blown research and development asset.
